<h1>MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY^^</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>My name is John Mateo Raboy, I am 18 years old and i was born on June,
        21 2007 in Basak, San Nicolas,Cebu City. I am the eldest child in our family. 
        My family consists of four members. Our house was small, but it was always full
        of laughter, music, and foods especially during holidays when the whole extended
        family came over. I loved playing computer games, reading manga, watching movies
        and anime, also thrifting, thrifting isn't just something i do for fun it's a part
        of who i am, I love the hunt, the feeling of finding something unique that rarely
        everyone has. I started thrifting when i was a teenager because i didn't have much
        money for clothes. But over time, it became more than just saving money. It became
        about expressing myself. Most of my favorite outfits are thrifted^^, btw i'm also
        a sleepyhead boy heh.

        Since my early school life,<br>
        I've learned discipline, good manners, and obedience from my teachers and parents.
        In school, I also learned important things like how to write and read, how to work
        with others, and how to manage my time. These things helped me shape who i am today.
        <br>

        <br>I've learned that life can be hard sometimes, but we can always learn from it,
        I learned that it's okay to take time and grow slowly. I also learned that being
        different is okay. Thrifting, my quiet side, and the things i enjoy make me who
        i am. Even small efforts everyday can help u improve. I still have a lot to learn,
        but i'm doing my best. <br>
        <br>
        Sometimes, I think about the people who’ve helped shape me my family, my friends, 
        my teachers, even strangers I’ve met along the way. Every interaction, big or small, 
        has taught me something. Whether it’s learning how to be kind, how to stand up for myself, 
        or simply how to listen, these lessons have stayed with me. I carry them with me as 
        I continue to grow. I believe that who we become is not just about what we do, but also 
        about the people who walk beside us, even for a short time. That’s why I try my best to 
        be someone others can rely on, even in small ways.
        <br>
        <br>I'm still growing and learning, but im proud of how far i've become. I want keep
        improving, stay true to myself, enjoy the journey, I don't know what the future
        holds, but i'm excited to find out.
